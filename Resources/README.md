This is my first portfolio.

I made this the 3rd week of Septemeber, 2022.

For this project I only used HTML & CSS, I look forward
to adding more and more functionability to my coding 
projects. This is a good first project for me as I hope it will 
show my growth throughout my course and carreer. 

I leaned more towards personal hobbies to attach for my about me section 
as I really do not have any coded projects of my own to share or 
display at this point in the course. 

One thing I will be sure to do next time is have a more structured 
plan of styling. For this project I achived the look I wanted in terms of 
colors and styles but I waited until the last day before I really 
started using any flex properties and this was a big mistake as I was
not as familiar as I thought I was and hence spent a lot of time
trying to get things in the best order.

This website is deffinitly not perfect but I am seeing things wrong with it
that I realize I would have never saw before if I did not start writing
my own code. This project has taught me a lot, mostly about how to find 
the answers I need but also how to interpret different ways people make 
and design their websites. 

- Resources -

The main resource I used was W3 schools.  They have the best library I 
have found so far with very easy to view examples of live code.
For all the elements I styled using pretty much the same structure as the 
W3 example I made sure to link to the page in my comments.
